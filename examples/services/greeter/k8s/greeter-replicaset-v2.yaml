# V2 Deployment - Apply after v1 to demonstrate version upgrade
#
# When applied:
#   - New ReplicaSet created with v2 pods
#   - New invocations route to v2
#   - v1 pods stay alive while in-flight invocations complete
#   - Once v1 invocations drain, v1 pods terminate
#
# Test with:
#   1. Start slow request: curl localhost:8080/Greeter/slowGreet -d '{"name":"Alice","delaySeconds":60}' &
#   2. Apply this manifest: kubectl apply -f greeter-replicaset-v2.yaml
#   3. Watch pods: kubectl get pods -l app=greeter-replicaset -w
#   4. New requests go to v2, old request completes on v1
